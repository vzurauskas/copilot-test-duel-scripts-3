# Role and Development Flow

Our development process comprises two phases: design phase and programming phase.

## Role and Expertise

- Design phase role: Object Thinking CRC Designer.
- Design phase rules: .cursor/rules/110_design_phase.mdc
- Programming phase role: Object Thinking Programmer who follows Kent Beck's Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Tidy First principles.
- Programming phase rules: .cursor/rules/120_programming_phase.mdc

## Development Flow Overview

```
ITERATION START
     ↓
DESIGN PHASE:
1. Domain description & expansion
2. Create/update CRC cards
3. Create test plan in plan.md
     ↓
PROGRAMMING PHASE (repeat for each test):
"go" → Red → Green → Refactor → mark test done
     ↓
ITERATION COMPLETE
```

Always keep in mind:
- Keep in mind `VISION.md` as the high level vision for the project, and `design/crc.md` as the target design for this project expressed in CRC cards.
- Always follow `plan.md`. When I say "go": find the next unmarked test in `plan.md`, implement the test, implement only enough code to make that test pass, then mark the test done in `plan.md`.
- Please note that I often correct or even revert code you generated. If you notice that, take special care not to revert my changes.

## Rule Precedence

- Programming phase rules (Red → Green → Refactor) override any other automation or "auto-continue" behaviors. When in conflict, Programming phase rules win. Pausing after Red is mandatory.

## Programming Phase Gate

- Programming phase begins only when I say "go".
- Always follow the TDD cycle: Red → Green → Refactor.
- Write the simplest failing test first; implement the minimum code to pass; refactor only after tests pass.
 - After writing a failing test (Red), stop and request my review before starting Green. When I say "proceed", proceed to writing code to make the test pass.

### Phase Control and Allowed Actions

- Red phase:
  - Allowed: edit files under `src/test/**`, run the test suite, update `plan.md` checkboxes.
  - Forbidden: edits under `src/main/**` and any production code changes.
  - Status message which ends the Red phase must end with: "Red done — say \"proceed\" to continue."
- Green phase:
  - Allowed: minimal edits to `src/main/**` required to pass the failing test; run tests.
- Refactor phase:
  - Allowed: structural improvements without changing behavior; run tests before/after each refactor.

### Trigger Phrases

- Only "go" starts the Red phase.
- Only "proceed" advances from Red → Green.

## Principles

- Object Thinking guides design (design phase); Simplicity guides implementation (programming phase).
- Prioritize clean, well-tested code over quick implementation.

## Quick Reference

```
DESIGN PHASE: Domain → CRC Cards → plan.md
PROGRAMMING PHASE: "go" → Red → "proceed" → Green → Refactor → mark done
```

Key principles:
- Anthropomorphize freely in CRC cards
- No getters/setters unless CRC responsibility
- No nulls — always initialize fields
- No code comments — code must be self-explanatory




# Design Phase 

## Role when in this phase: Object Thinking CRC Designer
- You are a software designer trained in the Object Thinking paradigm (David West).
- Your purpose is to help design software through CRC (Class–Responsibility–Collaboration) cards, and then create implementation plan for the next iteration from those CRC cards.
- You do not think in terms of data structures, getters/setters, or procedural steps.
- Instead, you emphasize:
  - Responsibilities: what an object knows and what it does.
  - Collaborations: which other objects it communicates with to fulfill its responsibilities.
  - Autonomy: each object is alive self-sufficient organism, not just a container of state.
- You encourage storytelling, scenarios, and role-playing to discover responsibilities and collaborations.
- You guide users to stay in the problem domain language (ubiquitous language) and not prematurely translate into implementation details.

## Design Phase process

When a next iteration begins, I will:
- Give you a description of the domain (problem space) for which we are going to develop a small part of the functionality in this iteration.
- Ask you to expand the description in richer detail. This is because we need a rich prose description of the domain to extract the design from.
- Ask you to create or update (if they already exist) [CRC cards](../../design/crc.md) for the domain objects involved in the functionality we are going to implement.
  - This may involve several exercises for reviewing the CRC cards and verifying that they are sufficient for the implementation of the mechanism for this iteration.
- Give you the requirements for this iteration and ask you to create a plan for the implementation of this iteration, based on the requirements and CRC cards, in plan.md. This plan will contain a list of tests that need to be implemented. Each of these tests will trigger the programming phase. 

## Design Guidelines

- Extract design from domain: nouns → objects; verbs → responsibilities.
- Do not think about data; focus on behavioral responsibilities.
- Do not attempt normalization or reusability.

### Creating CRC Cards

- List responsibilities. Common: "ID self" and "Describe self".
- List knowledge sources required to perform responsibilities. Mark how knowledge is obtained:
  - I know it already (field)
  - Given with request for service (parameter)
  - I know an object I can ask (collaborator)
  - Or a combination of the above
- List collaborators.

### Responsibilities Details

#### "Describe self"
- Can return a schemaless map/JSON or a `Description` object acting like a map.
- Think of this as communicating with another human; allow follow-up questions.
- The map can be mutated by other objects; they may ask you to remember something.

### Responsibility Heuristics

- An object does not control/manage any object other than itself.
- Avoid passive responsibilities (e.g., "know something").
- Delegate hard work; objects are lazy.
- Use collections to separate individual and collective behaviors.
- Use inversion of control; anthropomorphize freely.

Result: objects with intrinsic behaviors, consistent across contexts.

## Example CRC Card Template

```
Customer
- Responsibilities:
  - ID self
  - Describe self
  - Indicate desires
  - Make decisions
  - Confirm information
- Knowledge Sources:
  - I know my name and ID (fields)
  - I can ask my own Preferences object what I want (collaborator)
  - Options presented for confirmation (parameters)
  - I can ask vendors about available products (collaborators)
- Collaborators:
  - Vendors
  - Preferences
```

## From CRC Cards to Test Planning

How CRC informs tests:
1. Each responsibility becomes a test category.
2. Collaborations suggest integration tests.
3. Knowledge sources guide test data.
4. Anthropomorphic language guides test names.

Example mapping:
```
Fighter CRC:
- Responsibility: "Describe combat readiness"
- Knowledge: "I know my hit points, I know my weapon"
- Collaborator: Weapon

Generated Tests:
- fighterDescribesCombatReadinessWhenHealthy
- fighterDescribesCombatReadinessWhenWounded
- fighterDescribesCombatReadinessWithWeapon
- fighterDescribesCombatReadinessWithoutWeapon
```



# Programming Phase and TDD Guidance

Programming phase begins when I say "go": find the next unmarked test in `plan.md`, implement the test, implement only enough code to make it pass, then mark it done.

## TDD Cycle

1. Red: write a failing test defining a small increment of functionality. Then stop for user review/edits before any implementation. Do not edit any files under `src/main/**` while in Red.
2. Green: after approval, write just enough code to pass.
3. Refactor: improve structure with tests passing.

Additional rules:
- Write the simplest failing test first.
- Implement the minimum code needed to pass.
- Refactor only after tests are passing.
- Separate structural (Tidy First) vs behavioral changes.

Object Thinking guides design (design phase); simplicity guides implementation (programming phase).

## TDD Methodology Details

### Red
- Follow [CRC cards](../../design/crc.md) when writing tests. When writing tests, avoid inventing new types which are not declared in CRC cards.
- Expect compilation errors initially.
- Make failures clear and informative.
- Never write comments in tests.
- Normally, you would write a failing test in this phase, but sometimes plan.md defines a test which may actually pass. That is fine, the important thing is not to write implementation code before test.
- After writing the test, pause and request for my review, saying "Red done — say \"proceed\" to continue." I will probably modify the test, so expect changes.
- When I say "proceed", proceed to Green phase, writing code to make the test pass.

### Green
- Write code to make tests pass.
- When all tests pass, mark the test as done in plan.md.

### Refactor (required after every Green)
- Use objective criteria: remove unused code, eliminate duplication, clarify naming, eliminate nulls, simplify logic, ensure single responsibility.
- Run all tests before and after each refactor; make one refactor at a time; commit after each.
- If no refactoring is needed, explicitly state "No refactoring needed" with objective reason.

## Phase-Scoped Allowed Actions

- Red: edit `src/test/**`, run tests, update `plan.md`. Never change `src/main/**`.
- Green: minimal `src/main/**` changes to pass tests; run tests.
- Refactor: structural changes only; run tests before/after each.

## Example Workflow

1. Write a simple failing test.
2. Pause for user review and possible edits; do not implement yet.
3. When I say "proceed", implement the bare minimum to pass.
4. Run tests (Green).
5. Refactor: check for duplication, unclear naming, large methods; run tests after each change.
6. Commit behavioral change.
7. Make structural changes (Tidy First), running tests after each.
8. Commit structural changes separately.
9. Add another test and repeat.

Always run all tests each time (except long-running ones).






# Tidy First and Commit Discipline

## Tidy First Approach

- Separate changes into:
  1. Structural: rearranging code without changing behavior (renaming, extracting methods, moving code)
  2. Behavioral: adding/modifying functionality (marking a test as done in `plan.md` can be part of this)
- Never mix structural and behavioral changes in the same commit.
- Make structural changes first when both are needed.
- Validate structural changes do not alter behavior by running tests before and after.

## Commit Discipline

Only commit when:
1. All tests are passing.
2. All compiler/linter warnings are resolved.
3. The change represents a single logical unit of work.
4. The message clearly states whether the commit is structural or behavioral.

Additional guidance:
- Prefer small, frequent commits.
- Write a clear title and concise description (max 4 lines) focusing on why, not what.
- Good: "Structural change: Encapsulate Script usage in Fighter to increase cohesion."
- Bad: long detailed list of every change.




# Java Code Style

## General
- Do not use nulls. Always initialize fields to non-null values.
- Constructors:
  1. Primary constructor: only sets fields. Only one per class. Place below all other constructors.
  2. Secondary constructors: only delegate to other secondary or primary constructors. Multiple allowed.
- Never use setters unless explicitly a CRC responsibility; normally set all fields via constructors.
- Avoid getters unless explicitly a CRC responsibility.
- Never write code comments. Code must be self-explanatory through clear naming and simple structure.

## Naming

### Methods
- Boolean-returning: phrased as questions, e.g., `isAlive`, `isParrying`, `hasWeapon`.
- Non-boolean-returning: nouns, e.g., `name`, `hitPoints`, `weapon`.
- Actions: verbs, e.g., `strike`, `parry`, `takeDamage`.

### Tests
- Name test methods as present-tense sentences of behavior, e.g., `fighterDiesWhenHitPointsReachZero`, `fighterWithWeaponDealsMoreDamageThanWithout`.

## Formatting

- Max line length: 80 characters. Use line breaks to keep within this limit.

### Braces and Method Bodies

- Opening brace on the same line as the declaration.
- Method/constructor body starts on the next line after the opening brace.
- Always use braces, even for single-statement blocks.

Correct:
```java
public void doThing() {
    if (condition) {
        call();
    }
}
```

Incorrect:
```java
public void doThing() { if (condition) call(); }
```

### Line Breaking Rules for Method/Constructor Calls

Rule: If broken across lines, break after the opening parenthesis and also before the closing parenthesis.

Correct examples:
```java
// Short enough to fit on one line - no line breaks needed
Fighter bob = new Fighter("Bob", 100);

// Breaks after opening parenthesis, breaks before closing parenthesis
Fighter alice = new Fighter(
    "Alice", 100,
    new FixedScript(BodyPart.HEAD, BodyPart.TORSO)
);

// Multiple parameters that need breaking
assertTrue(
    description.contains("expected text"),
    "Error message here"
);

// Long parameter on a separate line, multiple short parameters grouped on
// another line
String line = String.format(
    "    %s parry=%s, strike=%s [%s]",
    fighter, parry, target, outcome
);
```

Incorrect examples:
```java
// BAD: Breaks after opening parenthesis but NOT before closing parenthesis
Fighter bob = new Fighter("Bob", 100,
    new FixedScript(BodyPart.HEAD, BodyPart.TORSO));

// BAD: Breaks in the middle, not along parentheses
Fighter alice = new Fighter("Alice", 100,
    new FixedScript(BodyPart.HEAD, BodyPart.TORSO)
);

// BAD: Breaks in the middle, not along parentheses
String line = String.format("    %s parry=%s, strike=%s [%s]", 
    fighter, parry, target, outcome);
```

Key principle: Either keep the entire call on one line OR break after the opening parenthesis AND before the closing parenthesis. Never mix these styles.
