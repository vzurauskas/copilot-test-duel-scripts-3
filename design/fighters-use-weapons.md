Two fighters fight each other in a duel until death. They can use their bare hands (fists), or weapons which deal more damage than fists. Weapons can be swords, axes, spears, etc.

The difference between a fist and a weapon isn't merely numerical—it's existential. When a fighter enters the arena bare-handed, each strike carries only the force of flesh and bone. A punch to the head might stagger, might bruise, but it rarely decides. The fighter knows this, feels it in the dull ache of knuckles meeting skull, in the grinding persistence required to wear an opponent down turn after turn. A weapon changes everything. Suddenly each strike carries intent sharpened to an edge, mass focused to a point, leverage multiplied through steel or wood. A sword doesn't just hurt more—it cuts through the tedium of attrition and makes each exchange potentially decisive.

Each weapon type expresses a distinct philosophy of violence. The sword embodies precision: moderate base damage, but with an elevated chance to find a critical opening—perhaps a gap in the opponent's defense, perhaps an unguarded instant when their parry shifts. When a sword strikes critically, the damage amplifies, and the fight's momentum can pivot in a single turn. (This critical-hit chance is intrinsic to the weapon itself; the sword "knows" its likelihood of finding such openings, so to speak.) The axe, by contrast, is brutal arithmetic: higher base damage with each landing blow, trading the sword's finesse for raw, consistent destruction. An axe to the torso doesn't need luck—it simply caves. The spear extends reach conceptually if not mechanically; its moderate base damage and rare critical strikes reflect a weapon designed for patience, for wearing down without overcommitting.

Consider a moment in the arena: two fighters, one wielding a sword, the other unarmed. The unarmed fighter strikes at the swordsman's head with a fist—a base damage value so low that even an unparried blow barely registers. The swordsman, in turn, targets the same head with a slash. The blade's base damage is triple that of the fist, and this turn, fortune aligns: a critical hit. The sword's damage multiplies, and what would have been a wounding blow becomes catastrophic. The fight history captures this clearly—"critical strike to head"—making the outcome observable, unmistakable. The unarmed fighter now understands viscerally that closing the weapon gap isn't optional; it's survival.

Or imagine another exchange: an axe-wielder facing a spear-fighter. The axe fighter commits to the torso, betting on high base damage to break through even if parried. The spear fighter, more cautious, also targets the torso but relies on consistent pressure rather than single devastating blows. Both strikes land unparried this turn. The axe's base damage—let's say 12—carves deeply; the spear's 8 still wounds, but the disparity is clear. Over time, the axe's philosophy—fewer, heavier blows—will assert itself unless the spear fighter's script adapts, perhaps targeting the axe-wielder's choice patterns to improve parry success. The history logs these damage totals per body part, and both fighters' scripts can query this record, learning which targets are proving effective, which weapons are dominating the exchange.

The weapon a fighter carries isn't just equipment—it's a tactical identity. A fighter wielding an axe signals a willingness to trade blow-for-blow, confident that their base damage will prevail. A sword-fighter embraces variance, hoping that critical strikes will punctuate the duel with decisive moments. A fighter entering with fists alone—perhaps as a handicap, perhaps as bravado—accepts that victory will require near-perfect defense and relentless attrition. The fight history makes these identities legible: each turn's outcome, each body part's accumulated damage, each weapon's signature pattern of harm. When the duel concludes, the narrative isn't just "who died" but "how their weapon shaped the way they died—or triumphed."
