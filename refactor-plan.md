# Copilot Instructions Refactoring Plan

## Current Issues
1. **Structure confusion**: Macro/micro cycle explanation is interleaved with TDD details
2. **Missing examples**: No concrete examples for CRC cards or "Describe self" pattern
3. **Unclear transitions**: When to switch between macro and micro cycles
4. **Conflicting guidance**: "Avoid getters" vs "Describe self" responsibility
5. **Missing plan.md template**: No guidance on structure
6. **Redundant content**: Some TDD content is repeated

## Refactoring Steps

### Step 1: Restructure for clarity
- [x] Separate macro-cycle and micro-cycle into distinct sections
- [x] Move all TDD details under micro-cycle
- [x] Create clear transition points between cycles
- [x] Add a high-level flow diagram in text

### Step 2: Integrate Object Thinking better
- [ ] Clarify how CRC cards inform test planning
- [ ] Resolve "avoid getters" vs "Describe self" conflict
- [ ] Add concrete examples of responsibilities in this domain
- [ ] Show how anthropomorphization applies during coding

### Step 3: Add practical examples
- [ ] Create sample CRC card for Fighter object
- [ ] Show example of "Describe self" implementation
- [ ] Add plan.md template with sample entries
- [ ] Show macroâ†’micro transition example

### Step 4: Clarify conflicting guidance
- [ ] Reconcile "avoid getters" with Object Thinking patterns
- [ ] Clarify when to use maps vs direct method calls
- [ ] Show how to balance simplicity with anthropomorphization

### Step 5: Streamline and organize
- [ ] Remove redundant TDD explanations
- [ ] Group related concepts together
- [ ] Ensure consistent terminology throughout
- [ ] Add quick reference section

## Expected Outcome
Clear, practical instructions that seamlessly integrate Object Thinking with TDD, with concrete examples specific to the Duel Scripts domain.
