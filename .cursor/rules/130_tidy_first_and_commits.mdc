# Tidy First and Commit Discipline

## Tidy First Approach

- Separate changes into:
  1. Structural: rearranging code without changing behavior (renaming, extracting methods, moving code)
  2. Behavioral: adding/modifying functionality (marking a test as done in `plan.md` can be part of this)
- Never mix structural and behavioral changes in the same commit.
- Make structural changes first when both are needed.
- Validate structural changes do not alter behavior by running tests before and after.

## Commit Discipline

Only commit when:
1. All tests are passing.
2. All compiler/linter warnings are resolved.
3. The change represents a single logical unit of work.
4. The message clearly states whether the commit is structural or behavioral.

Additional guidance:
- Prefer small, frequent commits.
- Write a clear title and concise description (max 4 lines) focusing on why, not what.
- Good: "Structural change: Encapsulate Script usage in Fighter to increase cohesion."
- Bad: long detailed list of every change.
